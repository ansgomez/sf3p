*  SF3P FRAMEWORK DEMO
*
*************************************************************

1. Open Terminal, change to your SF3P directory. To install, follow instructions in the README file.

2. Type the following commands:

	source sf3p_paths.sh
	alias sudo='sudo env PATH=$PATH $@'

    Description: These commands sets path variables, and configure 'sudo' with new paths
 
3. Type "cd examples"

    Description: This is where all the sample files are located. These are the default ones:
                 Each file describes the topology for different schedulers and parameters
                 such as simulation time, task periods, WCET, etc.

        edf.xml
        fifo.xml
        fixedpriority.xml
        fixedpriority_top.xml
        tdma.xml
        tdma_top.xml

4. Run the simulation, type "simulate edf"

    Description: 

        Simulation Phase
                 This will run the simulation, and generate several output files which 
                 need to be processed. They include timestamps and thread runtimes used
                 to determine metrics such as missed deadlines, and scheduling costs.

        Post-Processing Phase
                 This will process all the log files and calculate all releveant metrics. 
                 The results, with some basic statistics will be shown on screen.


    Metrics:

         Resource allocation cost - overhead from scheduling and context switching

         System Cost - includes also the 'dispatching' overhead, or generating tasks arrivals
